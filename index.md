## Code Projects

### Open Source Esri Projects

I have been working on the Esri Open Source team since July 2016. All apps described below have been architected and built by me and reviewed by API devs.

#### Indoor Routing

An iPhone app built with Xamarin. The app helps users navigate indoor spaces. It provides the ability to search for a room or a person, find them on the map and route to their location.

#### Maps App

A suite of 4 applications (WPF, UWP, iOS and Android) built with .NET cross-platform. The app helps user search for addresses or places anywhere in the world and route to those locations. It also lets them change the map style and if they have an [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html) account, it lets them load maps they have configured in ArcGIS Online.

#### Data Collection

A cross platform Windows Desktop (WPF & UWP) application that works in both online and offline modes. Using an ArcGIS Online pre-configured map, users can collect data out in the filed and sync it with the cloud version.

### Personal Projects

These are apps I have built as pet projects on my own time. 

#### Help Me Move

I built this app when I was looking to find where to move in the Portland area. It was also the app I showed during the Esri job interview. The app uses Esri tapestry data to determine best areas for someone to move based on some specified criteria.

#### Houston Traffic App

A Windows Phone app I built to help navigate the insanity that is Houston traffic. I wanted something very simple that I could access with minimal interraction and that would show me incidents on highways.
