## Open Source Esri Projects

I have been working on the Esri Open Source team since July 2017. All apps described below have been architected and built by me and reviewed by API devs.

### Indoor Routing

An iPhone app built with Xamarin. The app helps users navigate indoor spaces. It provides the ability to search for a room or a person, find them on the map and route to their location.

### Maps App

A suite of 4 applications (WPF, UWP, iOS and Android) built with .NET cross-platform. The app helps user search for addresses or places anywhere in the world and route to those locations. It also lets them change the map style and if they have an [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html) account, it lets them load maps they have configured in ArcGIS Online.
